      <description>Another day of coding with LibGDX, another annoying Android issue.
This time, it involves a Preferences object. I have a settings menu where the user can adjust things like sound effects volume, etc. There is a single Preferences object that lasts the entire lifetime of the game. In the settings menu, I read from and write to this object. And obviously I read the values elsewhere for the settings to take effect.</description>

      <description>Just a forewarning: this is not a definitive explanation for everything that can go wrong with your sound effects in LibGDX - just some information I learned while debugging some issues I ran into. I still have more questions than answers.
Sound effects are often one of the last things you will implement in an independent game project. You&#39;ve got this nearly complete game that just needs some polish in the form of bleeps and bloops.</description>
